🧠 Machine Learning Model Project

By Sabari Murugan S — Aspiring ML Engineer | Final Year AIML Student

Hello! I'm Sabari Murugan, a final-year BSc AIML student with a strong interest in building real-world Machine Learning solutions. This project is part of my learning journey to become a skilled ML Engineer / Data Scientist. It reflects my hands-on experience working with data — right from cleaning and preprocessing to building predictive models.
